# CS460-Project

In this project we will be making an interpreter that can ignore comments, tokenize, and more.


phase 1:
	can now ignore comments, given a c++ commented file, will now create a new
	file with name provided without the comments, being replaced by new line
	characters. still need to make it add a space for every commented character including the / and /*. 

	Usage: ./aaa [input filename] [output filename]
