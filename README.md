# CS460-Project

In this project we will be making an interpreter that can ignore comments, tokenize, and more.


phase 1:
	can now ignore comments, given a c-like commented file, will now output to
    console the uncommented version.


	Usage: ./(exec) [input filename] 
	Optionally: ./(exce) [input filename] >> [output filename]
